\title{Nine-dimensional "fuzzy" simplex}
\format{A data frame with 1000 rows and 10 variables}
\usage{
data(s1k)
}
\description{
A synthetic data set, consisting of a "fuzzy" nine-dimensional simplex: ten
points equidistant from each other (the length being 2). Each point in the
simplex has a separate label, "0" to "9".
}
\details{
Then for each vertex of the simplex, a further 99 points were generated,
sampled from a nine-dimensional Gaussian distribution centered at the
vertex, with a standard deviation of 0.5. Each of the points so generated
was given the same label as their "parent" vertex. This generated a
nine-dimensional dataset with 1000 instances and ten classes.

This data set is intended to fulfil the following criteria:
\enumerate{
 \item Not impossibly difficult: there's reasonable overlap of the
ten clusters of points, but the variance is isotropic and identical for each
cluster.
 \item Have an obvious right answer by visual inspection of the output map:
 do we see ten reasonably well separated blobs?
 \item Be sufficiently complex so that the "crowding problem" will
 manifest: in the original nine-dimensional input space, the ten classes are
 by definition equidistant from each other, so it's impossible for the input
 to be perfectly reproduced in the two-dimensional output map.
 \item Traditional distance-preserving mapping methods (e.g. PCA, MDS,
 Sammon mapping) shouldn't do a very good job, otherwise there's no point
 using a probability-based method.
}

The variables are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{D0}, \code{D1}, \code{D2} ... \code{D8} Real values, ranging
from -2.51 to 3.27.
\item \code{Label} The id of the simplex vertex that this point is
associated with, in the range 0-9. Stored as a factor.
