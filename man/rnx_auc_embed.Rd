\arguments{
\item{din}{Input distance matrix.}

\value{
Area under the RNX curve.
}
\description{
The RNX curve is formed by calculating the \code{rnx_crm} metric for
different sizes of neighborhood. Each value of RNX is scaled according to
the natural log of the neighborhood size, to give a higher weight to smaller
neighborhoods. An AUC of 1 indicates perfect neighborhood preservation, an
AUC of 0 is due to random results.
