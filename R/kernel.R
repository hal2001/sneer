# the kernel changing from asymmetric to symmetric (and vice versa again).

# @return Kernel with the type attribute of the function correctly set for
# its parameters.

#
# A similarity function for probability-based embedding.
#
# Applies exponential weighting to the distances, rather than the square of

# \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsne/index.html}{R tsne}

# Heavy-Tailed Similarity
#
# A similarity function for probability-based embedding.
#
# Applies a "heavy-tailed" similarity function that represents
# a generalization of the similarity functions used in SNE and t-SNE. The
# heavy-tailedness is with respect to that of the exponential functon.
# The weight matrix, \eqn{W} is generated from the squared distances matrix,
# \eqn{D^2}{D2} by:
# \deqn{W  = [(\alpha \beta D^2) + 1]^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{W = ((alpha * beta * D2) + 1) ^ (-1 / alpha)}
#
# \eqn{\alpha \to 0}{alpha approaches 0}, the weighting function becomes
# exponential, and behaves like \code{exp_weight}. At
# \eqn{\alpha = 1}{alpha = 1}, the weighting function is the t-distribution
# with one degree of freedom, \code{tdist_weight}. Intermediate
# values provide an intermediate degree of tail heaviness.
# The \eqn{\beta}{beta} parameter is equivalent to that in the
# \code{exp_weight} function. This is set to one in methods suchs as
# SSNE and t-SNE.
#
# @param d2m Matrix of squared distances.
# @param beta The precision of the function. Becomes equivalent to the
# precision in the Gaussian distribution of distances as \code{alpha}
# approaches zero.
# @param alpha Tail heaviness. Must be greater than zero.
# @return Weight matrix.

# Step Weight
#
# A similarity function for probability-based embedding.
#
# This function returns a value of one for input data less than or equal to
# the beta parameter, and zero otherwise.
#
# Useful for emulating a k-nearest neighbor style of weighting, as favored by
# Yang and co-workers (see the publication list). Note that the value of beta
# of beta is clamped so that it can't be smaller than the smallest value in the
# input matrix. This is to stop the output weights all being zero, which
# results in a uniform probability and hence a large perplexity. This can
# cause problems for the bisection search used to find the target perplexity.
