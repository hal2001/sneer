# Degree Centrality
#
# Calculates the degree centrality of a probability matrix.
#
# The input probability matrix is weighted to create the symmetrized nearest
# neighbor graph. The degree centrality of node i is then the sum of row
# and column i, where the element \code{m[i, j]} of matrix \code{m} can be
# interpreted as the value of the weighted edge from point i to j.

# Convert an Embedding Method to a Weighted Version
#
# Modifies the similarity kernel of an embedding method so that each
# weight is further multiplied by the importance of the two observations the
# weight was based on.
#
# The new weight matrix, which we'll call the "importance" weight matrix, is
# calculated as
#
# \deqn{W_{imp} = WM}{W_imp = W*M}
#
# where W is the original weight matrix and M is the importance matrix, which
# is the outer product of an importance vector d with the same length as the
# number of observations in the dataset, i.e.:
#
# \deqn{M_{ij} = d_{i}d_{j}}{M_ij = di * dj}
#
# In the originating paper by Yang and co-workers, they suggest using the
# degree centrality of each observation as the importance. This involves
# interpreting the input probability matrix as a weighted adjacency matrix,
# i.e. treat the dataset as a fully connected graph, with weighted edges, where
# the weight for the edge between observation i and j is the input probability,
# p_ij.
#
# @param method Embedding method to convert into an importance weighted
# version.
# @param centrality_fn The importance function. By default, the
# degree centrality. Must be a function with the signature
# \code{centrality_fn(m)} where \code{m} is the nearest neighbor graph based
# on the input probabilities, and returning a vector with the same length
# as the number of rows of the matrix, where the ith element represent the
# centrality measure of the ith observation.
# @return Converted embedding method.

# Convert a Probability Matrix to a Nearest Neighbor Adjacency Graph.
#
# Weights a probability matrix so that it approximates a (possibly symmetrized)
# nearest neighbor graph. In the context of probability-based embedding, the
# nearest neighbor adjacency graph is the same as the weight matrix that would
# result if a step function was used, rather than the usual exponential
# weighting. Given a row probability matrix we can then map back to the nearest
# neighbor graph by multiplying each probability by the number of neighbors
# required, which is equivalent to the perplexity.

# neighbor graph is also symmetrized.
